## Set up:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) Version 19 or up
- PostgreSQL JDBC driver added to the project dependencies (Mine is using version 42.7.3)
- PostgreSQL database server (pgAdmin) installed and running
- Create the database, table, and appropriate columns by using DatabaseCreation.txt
- Update the information in the application (url, user, password) if there is any change

## Compile and run:
javac StudentManagement.java
java StudentManagement

Note: If there is an error message, check if the driver is in the same classpath with the application/check if we already add the driver to the dependencies.
Since I am using IntelliJ, here is the way I set up the driver: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MDPYDi01dM
Sorry for any inconvenience.
